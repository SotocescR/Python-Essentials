# Check Triangle Type üìê
# Instructions:
# Write a Python program to check a triangle is equilateral, isosceles or scalene.
# Ask the user for the measures of each side.
# Note:
# An equilateral triangle is a triangle in which all three sides are equal.
# A scalene triangle is a triangle that has three unequal sides.
# An isosceles triangle is a triangle with (at least) two equal sides.
# Example Expected Output:
# Input lengths of the triangle sides:                                    
# x: 6                                                                    
# y: 8                                                                    
# z: 12                                                                   
# Result: Scalene triangle
