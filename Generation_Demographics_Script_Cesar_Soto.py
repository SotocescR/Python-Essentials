# Generation Demographics Script ğŸ‘¶ğŸ‘¨ğŸ‘´
# Instructions: 
# Create a script that takes the following data as input:
# First name.
# Last name.
# Age.
# Once the user enters the data, your script should output the user's full name and the year he/she was born.
# In addition, depending on the year of birth the script should also print the corresponding Generation Demographic:
# If the person was born between 1940 and 1965: Baby Boomer.
# From 1966 to 1980: Generation X.
# From 1981 to 1996: Millenials.
# From 1997 to 2012: Generation Z.
# 2013 or after: Too young!
#from datetime import datetime  # import the datetime module
